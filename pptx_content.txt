The Blind Spots in Modern Security Passive Recording Standard cameras merely record events for later review, offering no real-time intervention or proactive threat mitigation. They act as historical archives rather than active deterrents. Motion Logic Traditional motion sensors are plagued by high false positive rates. Systems like ShotSpotter generate unconfirmed alerts between  80% and 92%  of the time, triggered by benign events. Acoustic Neglect Most security setups overlook crucial auditory cues. Critical sounds like gunshots or screams are often ignored until it is too late, missing vital early warning signs of danger. Manual Overhead Homeowners are overwhelmed by a constant barrage of notifications, many of which are false alarms. This "notification fatigue" causes users to disregard alerts, increasing risk. 80-92% False Positive Rate 8-20% True Positives

Introducing EchoSight Sentinel A dual-intelligence system that uses  Acoustical Awareness  to listen and  AI Vision  to verify, providing a proactive approach to security. Acoustical Awareness Listens for critical sounds in real-time with zero-latency response. AI Vision Analyzes visual data to verify threats and provide context. Real-Time Sound Identification Detects critical sounds like glass breaking, gunshots, and screams instantly. Instant Visual Verification Analyzes the exact moment of danger through AI vision. Intelligent WhatsApp Alerts Delivers human-descriptive notifications directly to your phone.

Response Time is Everything In emergency situations, every second counts. EchoSight Sentinel redefines emergency response with a zero-latency approach. Traditional Systems Significant delays in detection and response High false positive rates (80-92%) Reactive rather than proactive security EchoSight Sentinel Zero-latency detection and response Intelligent verification to eliminate false positives Proactive security that shifts from detection to prevention          Key Takeaway:  EchoSight Sentinel's zero-latency approach transforms emergency response from reactive to proactive, ensuring critical threats are addressed immediately.

Deep Learning Audio Classification Custom CNN Architecture Dynamic Energy Thresholding Temporal Voting Analyzing audio events within a sliding window and requiring a majority vote eliminates impulsive, non-threatening noises. Refined Dataset The models are trained on a meticulously curated dataset, specifically engineered to distinguish between actual gunshots and common background "pops". Audio Classification Process Sound Capture Audio input from sensitive microphones Pre-processing Dynamic energy thresholding Feature Extraction Mel-spectrogram conversion Classification CNN analysis with temporal voting Alert System WhatsApp notification if threat detected Silence and irrelevant background noise are filtered out at the hardware level, reducing computational load. The CNN is specifically designed and trained on Mel-spectrogram signatures, excelling at identifying distinct acoustic patterns.

Past-Present AI Verification Rolling 2-Second Video Buffer Frame 2 Frame 3 Frame 4 Frame 5 Frame 6 Frame 7 Frame 8 Frame 9 Frame 10 Frame 11 Rolling 2-Second Buffer The system continuously captures and stores a 2-second video buffer in memory, ensuring access to critical moments before and during an event. Llama 4 Scout Integration Utilizing the advanced Llama 4 Scout multimodal AI to perform deep analysis of a 10-frame burst from the buffered video. Contextual Reasoning The AI provides human-descriptive summaries like "Person brandishing a tool" rather than raw data, offering actionable intelligence. False Positive Silencing Intelligently suppresses alerts for false positives (e.g., child with toy gun), preventing notification fatigue and ensuring critical warnings.
